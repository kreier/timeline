Ba̱smath

The string looks like "Basmath" with a combining diacritic under the a. Let’s decompose it:
- B → U+0042 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B
- a → U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A
- ̱ → U+0331 COMBINING MACRON BELOW
- s → U+0073 LATIN SMALL LETTER S
- m → U+006D LATIN SMALL LETTER M
- a → U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A
- t → U+0074 LATIN SMALL LETTER T
- h → U+0068 LATIN SMALL LETTER H
So the sequence is:

🔎 Step 2: Why HarfBuzz might struggle
HarfBuzz is a text shaping engine. It takes Unicode code points and applies OpenType rules from fonts. If you just pass raw bytes without normalization, you may get unexpected results:
- The a̱ (a + combining macron below) is not a single precomposed character in Unicode.
- Fonts may or may not have glyphs for this combination. HarfBuzz relies on the font’s GSUB/GPOS tables to position the combining mark correctly.
- If the font doesn’t support combining marks well, you’ll see misplacement or fallback rendering.
